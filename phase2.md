## Domain Description ##
The domain that we have decided to make a project on is regarding health the main reason why we are motivated to work on this project is becasue of the main issue of COVID-19 
We are willing to design an app to help those who are worried just because they can't find beds or they dont know if there are any nearby hospitals which can conduct test for 
COVID-19 . By the help of this app we will make it sure that every one will find it easy to locate nearby hopitals where they can get themselves tested for COVID-19 as well as
they can find bed for their patients easily.If by making this app we can fight COVID-19 it is enough for us to get motivated and start working on this app !

## Task.2: Medicine Price Comparsion: ##

As you know because of COVID-19 many of the people are getting jobless they have very few savings and due to high prices of medicine they are not able to purchase them with the help of this app 
they will be able to compare medicines of two different comapnies and will be able to purhcase those medicines

The prospect of this tehcnology use is for digital use we will design this app for mobile devices so that everyone can carry our app in there pockets 

## NEED FINDING: ##
People around the world are facing the worst situation due to the COVID-19, also called the Coronavirus. The virus is a severe pandemic that has disrupted lives, collapsed economies, and destroyed businesses globally. As the disease spreads worldwide, hospitals are running out of quarantine space to isolate infected individuals. People who have slight symptoms quarantine themselves in their homes. So I decided to create app which help this app is to aid corona patients stuck at home. Create a delivery app through which patients living on their own can get medicines. This apps will teach simple meditation and mental relaxation techniques that people can practice themselves at home easily. 

## SCENARIO: ##
The most common symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Symptoms can also include chills and repeated shaking, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of sense of taste or smell. Symptoms typically appear within 2 days to 14 days after exposure. In this situation covid patient facilitate from this app user use this app and connect with doctors. Online doctor guide what to do and perception of medicine told the patient and told the precaution to safe this virus and other hand the patient in serious condition user reserve the bed and find near hospitals and delivery or oxygen box and other safety kid’s, rider drop these things at your home through this app.

Nowadays, the major target is corona virus patient use this app and facilitate and our message for user is stay safe stay healthy.

**This app is very useful for covid patient at this pandemic situation**

- The app should be user friendly and user/customer supported in this pandemic situation, so that the user/customer can avail full benefit of such application an safe at home from this virus.
- This application provides an appropriate and attractive UI display to attract the customer and provide such facility for covid patient online test online doctor available 24hours for treatment and guide what to do next step.
