## Domain Description ##
The domain that we have decided to make a project on is regarding health the main reason why we are motivated to work on this project is becasue of the main issue of COVID-19 
We are willing to design an app to help those who are worried just because they can't find beds or they dont know if there are any nearby hospitals which can conduct test for 
COVID-19 . By the help of this app we will make it sure that every one will find it easy to locate nearby hopitals where they can get themselves tested for COVID-19 as well as
they can find bed for their patients easily.If by making this app we can fight COVID-19 it is enough for us to get motivated and start working on this app !

-locate beds
-symptoms checker
-find nearby hospitals
-Doctor available or not
-Kits available or not

###Task 1: Symptoms checker###
By the help of this feature people will be able to find if they have the symptoms of COVID-19 or not if they will be having those symptoms then nerby hospitals with avalaibale doctors will be located 

###Task 2: Medicine Price Comparsion###
As you know because of COVID-19 many of the people are getting jobless they have very few savings and due to high prices of medicine they are not able to purchase them with the help of this app 
they will be able to compare medicines of two different comapnies and will be able to purhcase those medicines
