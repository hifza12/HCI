## Domain Description ##
The domain that we have decided to make a project on is regarding health the main reason why we are motivated to work on this project is becasue of the main issue of COVID-19 
We are willing to design an app to help those who are worried just because they can't find beds or they dont know if there are any nearby hospitals which can conduct test for 
COVID-19 . By the help of this app we will make it sure that every one will find it easy to locate nearby hopitals where they can get themselves tested for COVID-19 as well as
they can find bed for their patients easily.If by making this app we can fight COVID-19 it is enough for us to get motivated and start working on this app !
